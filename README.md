# Growth Mindset

## Growth mindset is the ability to focus on learning and gathering knowledge. It is not based on "innate intelligence" but rather the ability to continually grow.

# *I will remember to utilize a growth mindset by:*

## 1. __Persevering when I run into obstacles.__
## 2. Utilizing tools such as google to continue to learn.
## 3. ***Ask for help when needed.***
