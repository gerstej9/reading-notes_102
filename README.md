# Growth Mindset

## Growth mindset is the ability to focus on learning and gathering knowledge. It is not based on "inate intelligence" but rather the ability to continually grow.

# _I will remember to utilize a growth mindset by:_

## - __Perservering when I run into obstacles.__
## - Utilizing tools such as google to continue to learn.
## - Ask for help when needed.
