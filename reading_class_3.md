# Class 3 Reading Notes

## HTML, Javascript, and CSS
* HTML is the first layer and contains content
* CSS is the presentation layer
* Javascript is the behavior layer and provides interactivity
* The three layers provide the basis of progressive enhancement when it comes to building webpages
* Starting with HTML allows for focus on content
* CSS next seperates the content from design
* Javascript adds enhanced usability and the experience of intera ting with the site
* Like CSS, Javascript files can be linked to in HTML
* You can also add JavaScript in the HTML between script tags

## JavaScript
* Calling a method of an object
    * Object.method(parameters);
    * ```document.write('Good Afternoon!');
    * Lots of objects like document and methods like write that will help write whole scripts
    * Javascript runs where it is found in HTML i.e. where the script element is

## JS Statements and Comments
* Scripts provide a series of instructions, each one is known as a statement and should end with a semi-colon
* Javascript is case sensitive
* Each statement starts on a new line
* Statements can be organized into code blocks using curly braces these are not followed by semi-colons
* Code blocks can be used to group together multiple statements for organization and readability
* Comments should be included in code to help yourself and others when reading it
* Multi-line comments ```/* hello*/```
* Single-line comments ```//```

## Variables
* Data can be stored as variables
* Variables can be considered short term memory because the page holds the data only while user is on the page
* Data in variables can change each time the script is run
* To declare a variable you need variable keyword and name
    * ```var quantity;```
    * Variable names should be written in camelCase if using multiple words
* Once a variable has been created you can assign a value to it, = sign is the assignement operator
    *  ```quantity = 3;```
* Until a variable is assigned it is considered undefined
* Variable shorthand is sometimes used to create variables
    * Variable is declared and values assigned in same statement
    * Three variables are declared on same line then values assigned to each
    * Two variables are declared then a third is declared and assigned on next line
    * Variable used to hold a reference to an element in the HTML page
* Variables can be changed later in the same script
* Rules for naming variables
    1. name must begin with a letter, dollar sign, underscore and not a number
    1. Name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign, or underscored but no dashes or periods
    1. No keywords or reserved words can be used for instance var
    1. All variables are case sensitive, do not create variables with the same name but in different cases
    1. Use a name that describes the kind of information the variable stores
    1. Use camelCase when naming variables with multiple words included

## Data Types
* Numeric data
* String data includes letters and characters
* Boolean are true or false
* Variables can store numbers, strings, or booleans
* Strings are kept in quotations either single or double
* To add quotes inside either use escape character such as backslash or use the opposite quote marks to surround the string i.e. single or double


# Computer Architecture and Logic

## How Computers Work
* Computers help us with thinking work
* Taking input, storing information, processing it and outputting it
* Early computers were made out of metal and wood
* Computers take data from memory, process it using algorithms, and then return it to storage
* Computers output information through displays, signals, and other means

## Binary and Data
* Computers work on 1's and 0's
* An electrical wire can be yes or no, 1 or 0 depending on if electricity is or isnt flowing (known as a bit)
* Binary number system can represent any number
* 32 wires can show up to billions of numbers
* Text, images, and sound can also be represented by binary numbers

## Circuits and Logic
* Simple circuit takes a signal and flips it, Not circuit
* Complicated circuits can take multiple signals and combine them into different results
* Simple circuits can be added together to create more complicated processing, such as an adder
* Circuits can be placed side by side to increase functionality
* Smaller circuits allow for faster processing

## CPU, Memory, Input, Output
* Storage involves memory and CPU for processing
* Computers can take many different types of input
* Input is converted into binary numbers
* CPU calculates how to display output and stores it in memory before outputting
* The more complicated input and output are the greater need for larger memory and faster CPU/more CPUs

## Hardware and Software
* Hardware comprises physical aspects of computing
* Software comprises intangible aspects such as programs
* CPU is the master chip that controls all computer functions
* CPU consists of different types of circuits for different functions
* Operating systems are the master programs that allow for the control of other programs on the system
* Operating system switches between running programs
* Each software is comprised of binary code managed by operating system
