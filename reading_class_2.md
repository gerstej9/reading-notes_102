* HTML
    * Describes the structure of web pages
    * Tags act like containers
    * Opening tags and closing tags
    * Attributes provide more information about elements such as names and values
    * Web page source code is viewable through web browsers
    * HTML has evolved through several versions since its creation
    * DOCTYPE declares which version of HTML a web site is using
    * Utilize comments when coding websites
    * ID attributes allow elements to be uniquely stylized and are also known as global attributes
    * Class attributes can be used to identify several elements
    * Block elements start on a new line ( h1, p, ul, li)
    * Inline elements appear on the same line as neighboring elements such as (a, b, em, img)
    * Grouping text and elements in a box can be achieved through div and allows for sectioning of a page
    * Span element acts as an inline version of div and is used to differentiate inline conten
    * Class or an id are usually used with span
    * iframe allows for a window inside a page or in other words an inline frame, needs a src for url and height and width
    * iframes can have scrolling (yes, no, or auto), frameborders ( 0 or 1), or in HTML5 be seamless
    * meta element lives inside the head and does not have closing tag, not visible to users but contains information about web page. 
    * meta elements use name attribute to provide description, keywords, and robots which are often used by search engines. 
    * meta elements use http-equiv to define author, pragma, and expiration
    * Escape characters can be used to show characters otherwise used in HTML, such as ampersand escape character is `&gt;`

* HTML 5
    * HTML 5 adds new elements for dividing page
    * Header and footer
    * Navigation (nav)
    * Article element acts as a container for sections of a page that can stand alone
    * Aside element has two purposes, when used inside an article it has information related but not essential to the artical. When used outside an article it is a container for content related to the entire page such as links to other sections of the site
    * Section element refers to groups of similarly related content and typically when each section has its own heading
    * hgroup element is to group together one or more h1 through h6 elements so they are treated as one heading
    * figure refers to images, videos, graphs, diagrams, code samples etc. that are refered to in the main flow, usually should have a figcaption as well to provide text description.
    * div is revised to group together related elements when no other suitable grouping element is available. 
    * HTML5 uses a elements around a block level element to contain child elements allowing you to turn an entire block into a link
    * Older browsers need help with HTML5 sites meaning you need CSS code to account for this. Work arounds also include HTML.shiv or HTML.shim
