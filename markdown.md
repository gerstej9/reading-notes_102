# Markdown: A Summary

## Utilizing markdown a user is able to add many different elements to a webpage. Some of these elements include
* *Italics*
  * ```*Italics*```
* **Bold font**
  * ```**Bold Font**```
* ***Or Both!***
  * ```***Bold and Italic***```
  
  
## In addition to the text styles that you can implement above. You can also add other functional aspects too such as;
 * > Hello World!
  * ```> Quotes```
 * [Links](https://gerstej9.github.io/reading-notes/)
  * ``` [Text](URL)```
  
## And lastly, if you want to put code in a website so that others can use it like I have done above. You can do so by adding three tildas on either side of text like so ```hello```.
* ``` how to make a code box```
