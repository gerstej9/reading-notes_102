# What I learned using git for the first time

* Creating directories to store repositories
    * ```mkdir "folder name"```
* Cloning repositories from Github
    * ```git clone "url"```
* You are able to bypass the need for inputting a password on pushes if you enter your repository URL as follows
    * ```git clone https://username@repository-url.com```
