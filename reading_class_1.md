## Differences between text editors

### Text editors can be broken into two different categories:
  * Word Processors
    * Microsoft Word etc.
  * Code-specific Text Editors
    * Third Party Apps 
    * Apps native to a Mac or windows

## Command Line
  * Using the terminal is a different way to navigate your compute than the GUI
  * The terminal utilizes commands that allow you to use all the same functions as the GUI
  such as opening folders and creating or copying files.
  * There is an operating shell, zsh for Mac OS
  * Some of the commands are as follows
    * Open a folder ```cd (folder)```
    * Make a directory ```mkdir (folder name)```
    * Create a new file ```touch (file name)```
    * Copy a file ```cp (file template) (new filename) ```
    * Open a text editor ```code```
    * List of files or folder ```ls```
  * For more complicated operations you have to download packages such as homebrew or nvm
  
## Paths
  * There are two types of paths
    * Relative: A file or folder relative to current location in a file system
    * Absolute: A file or folder relative to root system.
  * Root directory refers to the top of the directory in the hierarchical system
  * Code for paths
    * ```pwd``` lists current directory
    * ``` .. ``` refers to parent directory
    * ```.``` refers to current directory
    * ```~``` refers to home directory 
    
## Files
  * Everything is a file
  * File extensions denote what type of a file something is i.e. .jpg
  * The ```file``` command will show what type of a file a certain file is
  * Linux is case sensitive
  * Linux does not like spaces
  * Quotes denote one entire item
  * A ```\``` nullifies the next character
  * Files can be hidden, use ```ls -a``` to show all files including hidden ones.
